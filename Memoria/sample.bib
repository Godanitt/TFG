  abstract = {This article addresses three of the four nucleosynthesis processes involved in producing heavy nuclei beyond Fe (with a main focus on the r-process). Opposite to the fourth process (the s-process), which operates in stellar evolution during He- and C-burning, they are all related to explosive burning phases, (presumably) linked to core collapse supernova events of massive stars. The (classical) p-process is identified with explosive Ne/O-burning in outer zones of the progenitor star. It is initiated by the passage of the supernova shock wave and acts via photodisintegration reactions like a spallation process which produces neighboring (proton-rich) isotopes from pre-existing heavy nuclei. The reproduction of some of the so-called lighter p-isotopes with A<100 faces problems in this environment. The only recently discovered νp-process is related to the innermost ejecta, the neutrino wind expelled from the hot proto-neutron star after core collapse and the supernova explosion. This neutrino wind is proton-rich in its early phase, producing nuclei up to 64Ge. Reactions with neutrinos permit to overcome decay/reaction bottlenecks for the flow beyond 64Ge, thus producing light p-isotopes, which face problems in the classical p-process scenario. The understanding of the r-process, being identified for a long time with rapid neutron captures and passing through nuclei far from stability, is still experiencing major problems. These are on the one hand related to nuclear uncertainties far from stability (masses, half-lives, fission barriers), affecting the process speed and abundance peaks. On the other hand the site is still not definitely located, yet. (i) Later, possibly neutron-rich, high entropy phases of the neutrino wind (if they materialize!) could permit its operation. (ii) Other options include the ejection of very neutron-rich neutron star-like matter, occurring possibly in neutron star mergers or core collapse supernova events with jets, related to prior stellar evolution with high rotation rates and magnetic fields. Two different environments are required for a weak and a main/strong r-process, witnessed by observations of low metallicity stars and meteoritic inclusions, which could possibly be identified with the two options listed above, i.e. the weak r-process could be related to the neutrino wind when changing from p-rich to n-rich conditions.}

The weight of the different 10Li configurations in the system's ground state is obtained from the structure calculations unambiguously. The effect of the 9Li spin in the calculated observables is also investigated. We find that, although all the considered models succeed in reproducing the shape of the data, the magnitude is very sensitive to the content of p1/2 wave in the 11Li ground-state wave function. Among the considered models, the best agreement with the data is obtained when the 11Li ground state contains approximately 31\% of p1/2 wave in the n-9Li subsystem. Although this model takes into account explicitly the splitting of the 1+ and 2+ resonances due to the coupling of the p1/2 wave to the 3/2 spin of the core, a similar degree of agreement can be achieved with a model in which the 9Li spin is ignored, provided that it contains a similar p-wave content.}

This versatile detector is a gaseous thick target that allows the tracking of charged particles in three dimensions and provides a precise reaction energy reconstruction from the vertex position. A commissioning experiment using resonant scattering of a 3.2MeV/nucleon 18O beam on an isobutane gas (proton) target was performed. The beam and the heavy scattered ions were stopped in the gas volume, while the light recoil left the active volume and were stopped in auxiliary silicon detectors. A dedicated tracking algorithm was applied to determine the angle of emission and the length of the trajectory of the ions, to reconstruct the reaction kinematics used to built the excitation functions of the 1H(18O, 18O)1H and 1H(18O, 15N)4He reactions. In this article, we describe the design of the detector and the data analysis, that resulted in center of mass reaction energy resolutions of 38(4)keV FWHM and 54(9)keV FWHM for the proton and alpha channels, respectively.}

abstract = {Experimental studies of light dripline nuclei are reviewed. Progress in the production of very short lived nuclei and the development of radioactive nuclear beams has given this field the necessary tools for detailed studies of the most exotic nuclei. A well-known feature for some of the light dripline nuclei is that under certain circumstances they may form a neutron or a proton halo with a dilute mass distribution extending far outside the core of the nucleus. The first observation of halo states was made in the middle of the 1980s and it generated an interest in dripline physics, both experimentally and theoretically, that has gone far beyond the study of halo states. The experimental results for halo states are starting to give a fairly complete understanding of their structure in many cases. The data include masses, spins, moments, reaction data over a wide energy range and beta-decays. There are two main classes of halo state: the two-body halos with one nucleon surrounding the core, like the one-neutron halos 11Be and 19C and the one-proton halo 8B; and the Borromean three-body halos with two valence nucleons around the core, the key examples being 6He, 11Li and 14Be. Experimental information about systems lying just outside the dripline play an important rôle in understanding the structure of the halo states, examples being 10Li and 13Be, which form two-body subsystems of 11Li and 14Be, respectively. Unbound resonance states that correspond to exotic unbound quantum systems like 5H, 7H and 9He have been identified. There are continuum states existing above the particle separation threshold as well as spectra indicating cluster or molecular structure. The traditional magic numbers valid for more stable nuclei have been found to disappear and be replaced with new ones in the dripline regions. The beta-decays in these regions may give access to halos in excited states and the associated beta-delayed particle decay modes provide information about coupling to the continuum. After a short historical overview, examples on the most recent experimental results from this rapidly growing field of nuclear physics will be given.}
